LoadJS
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guidomb/loadjs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guidomb/loadjs)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/loadjs.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/loadjs)

**LoadJS** provides a way to load page-specific Javascript code in a Rails app without loosing the magic
provided by Sprockets. All your Javascript code will continue by minified in one Javascript file but
some portions of it will only be executed for certain pages.

*This version ONLY provides support for Turbolinks 5, removing the `$(document).ready(...)` function listener to `$(document).on('turbolinks:load', ...)` listener.*

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'loadjs'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install loadjs

## Usage

After installing the gem, you need to modify your `application.html.erb` and add the following attributes to the `body`
tag:

```
<html>
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body data-controller="<%= controller.controller_path %>" data-action="<%= controller.action_name %>">
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Then you need to require `loadjs` in your application manifest:

```
//= require loadjs
```

Finally if you want a block of code just to be excuted for a specific controller and action you must use the `load`
function like this:

```javascript
load({controller: 'foo', action: 'bar'}, function (controller, action) {
  alert("Hello World!");
});
```

This piece of code will only be evaluated after the DOM has been loaded and only for the controller `foo` and action `bar`.
If you want to execute a piece of code for all the actions in a controller you can omit the `action` option.

You can also use a shorter version like this:

```javascript
load("foo#bar", function (controller, action) {
  alert("Hello World!");
});
```

If you want a block of code to be executed for multiple controllers and multiple actions you can do it like this:

```javascript
load({
    controllers: {
        controller1: ['action1', 'action2', 'action3'],
        controller2: ['action2'],
        controller3: []
    }
}, function(controller, action) {
    alert("Hello " + controller + " and " + action);
});
```
